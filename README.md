FileSystemForensics
============

### a tool to inspect, extract, files and file system metadata. It currently supports NTFS, gradually BTRFS support will be added. 



By using this tool, you can explore NTFS and its file system attributes. You can selectively extract filesystem information of a record, or for a range of records. In addition, you can export the contents of files. 

Exporting files can be achieved either by mounting the evidence and providing its physical drive order and partition number or by using the acquired forensic image (Expert Witness Format), or a virtual machine disk format (VMDK). 

#### Examples #####
you can explore NTFS by providing physical drive number and partition number 

e.g. *-physicaldrive 0 -partition 1* translates to \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE0 D drive respectively,


or by using as input an expert witness format image 

e.g. *-evidence path_to_evidence -partition 1*.
